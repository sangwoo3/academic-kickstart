Hi! My name is Sangwoo Cho or 조상우 (in Korean) and I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science Department](http://cs.ucf.edu/) at the [University of Central Florida](http://www.ucf.edu/) . My research interests include Computer Vision, Video Action Recognition, Natural Language Processing, Automatic Text Summarization, and Deep Learning. I am currently under the supervision of [Dr. Hassan Foroosh](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~foroosh/) in the [CIL](<http://cil.cs.ucf.edu/>) and [Dr. Fei Liu](<http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~feiliu/>) in the [UCF NLP group](<http://www.nlp.cs.ucf.edu/>).



My current research focuses on two folds: human action recognition and extractive text summarization of news articles. More specifically, I am working on video and skeleton based human action recognition, which takes a video or key points of a human body and predicts human activities. It is important to extract spatial and temporal information carefully as videos contain both information. Another research topic I am working on is multi-document summarization, which seeks to take a cluster of multiple articles and create one summary.  This requires special process to focus on the most important information, while avoiding redundancy that is common in multi-document clusters.
